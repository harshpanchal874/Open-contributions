**Image Segmentation** is the process of dividing a digital image into different subdivisions (of pixels) known as Image Objects, which reduces the picture&#39;s complexity and makes it so much easier to analyse.

It can be used to solve a variety of real-world problems, including tumour cells identification and plenty of others where segmentation is crucial.

**Contours:** A contour is a diagram that represents a item that we already gave to our computer for detection. In Python, contours are a group of objects, which could be a picture, the frame of some video, or just about anything else. They are primarily used in the detection of multiple kinds of items by providing a variable to preserve the picture along with its colour conversion by using cv2.cvtcolor() technique.

**Shape detection** is typically the responsibility of locating as well as detecting different shapes in a photograph. Computers may indeed be trained to detect shapes in photographs using OpenCV by supplying them with particular information and analysing certain factors, and then allowing them to act in accordance with the decision. It entails first downloading and then installing required libraries. Thereafter, you may examine the image and then let the computer recognise it by implementing the ShapeDetector class. Finally, output will be displayed.

**Image features** are divided into two types: feature detection plus feature description. In feature detection, a picture is input, and the pixel co-ordinates of that visual are displayed as an outcome. Feature description, on the other hand, separates a feature from some of the other image elements in a picture.

We can also use OpenCV to merge two images into one. The blurring of a photograph can also be performed in collaboration with the smoothing of a picture to reduce noise. The applyColorMap() method can also be used to map different colours. The cv2.corberHarris(), cv2.Canny(), and cv2.findCirclesGrid() methods can all be used to detect corners, as well as edges and grids.

**Face detection** is a type of computer vision that helps recognise and visualise human faces in digital images. This technique combines object recognition intelligence with modern photo and video to recognise samples of conceptual items of a particular class (including such individuals, buildings, and vehicles).Face recognition has become more crucial as technology is advancing. Finally, we learned how to use Flask to create a web application that distinguishes faces, which only served to improve our OpenCV fundamentals.
